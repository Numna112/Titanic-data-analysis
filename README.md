introduction
Here I will work on an exploratory data analysis and Mechine Learning based on the Titanic data set using python. In a first step we will investigate the Titanic data set. Kaggle provides a train and a test data set. The train data set contains all the features possible factors and the target variable ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106012011/169688667-53388462-6369-4590-837d-f3abc7f42c27.png)

Importing Libraries
Importing titanic Dataset
Data Cleaning
Converting Categorical Features
Building a Logistic Regression model
Training and predictins
Machine learning
Splitting the data for train and test
The train test split procedure is used to estimate performance of Mechine learning algorithm when they are used to make predictions. This procedure involves taking a dataset and dividing it into two subsets. The first subset is used to fit the model and is refferd to as training dataset. The second subset is used to the input element of the data set is provided to the model. Then prediction are made and compared to the expected values. The second data set is referred to as testing data set.

conclusions
more than 550 people has not survived and more tha 300 people survived
When we look in to gender wise data there are more male boarded tha females (577 males and 312 females).However survival rate of female are higher than that of man.
Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms which comes under the supervised learning technique.It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variable.

Accuracy 100 %
